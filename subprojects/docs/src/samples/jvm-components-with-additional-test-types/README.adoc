This sample shows how to add additional test types to JVM projects in Gradle.
Test types are also known as unit test, integration test, functional test, etc.
In this sample, we are testing Java projects with JUnit 4, however, adding additional test types is consistent across JVM languages.

Applications can be configured as follow:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="application/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="application/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

Libraries can be configured as follow:

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="library/build.gradle[]"]
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="library/build.gradle.kts[]"]
====

The additional tests for the projects can be executed via the `integrationTest` task or as part of lifecycle `check` task as demonstrated:

====
[.testable-sample,dir="groovy"]
=====
[.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew check
